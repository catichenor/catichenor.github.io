		</h2>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<p>The goal of this site, at least for now, is for public accountability of my efforts toward learning algorithms. As I’ve found out, it’s really quite difficult to get a job involving even entry-level coding without knowledge of algorithms pulled randomly out of a book (and apparently unrelated to actual life/job experience). I’m definitely not an entry-level coder, but I’m largely self-taught and thus have little background in algorithms.</p>
<p>So how shall I study these? There’s a few variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>What language to use.</li>
<li>What sites provide the best path to learning.</li>
<li>What learning method to use.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Language</h2>
<p>I’m thinking four possibilities: C/C++, Java, JavaScript, Python </p>
<h3>C, then C++ for OO</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pros<ul>
<li>Closer to the metal, will learn manual memory management </li>
<li>Many tutorials map closely to the specific data structure implementations of the C family </li>
<li>Many imaging libraries, especially on embedded hardware, use C++</li>
<li>More impressive in interviews(?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cons<ul>
<li>I haven’t used either C or C++ much in a decade.</li>
<li>Have to learn the idiosyncrasies of two (related) languages.</li>
<li>Code is more “fiddly”, will take longer thair complete lessons.</li>
<li>Have to manually manage memory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Java</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pros<ul>
<li>Used by most automation engineers from what I can tell.</li>
<li>Doesn’t have as many "sticky points" as C/C++</li>
<li>Only have to use one language.</li>
<li>My most recent programming classes used Java, so this should be “review”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cons<ul>
<li>I haven’t used Java much in the past decade, either.</li>
<li>Pretty far from technologies I’m interested in (except maybe Scala).</li>
<li>In something of a no man’s land between low-level and high-level languages.</li>
<li>Icky, boilerplate-y.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pros<ul>
<li>Will he helpful for front-end web (and maybe backend) programming.</li>
<li>I’ve used JavaScript much more recently than Java and C/C++</li>
<li>Good excuse to learn new JavaScript enhancements </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cons<ul>
<li>Not really suited for algorithms </li>
<li>More of a functional language with C-ish syntax</li>
<li>Almost a DSL for browsers (I know, Node.js makes it a server language, but that ship seems to be sailing...)</li>
<li>High-level</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Python</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pros<ul>
<li>The primary language I'm currently using.</li>
<li>I've lots of tooling to support my work.</li>
<li>Pythonista gives me a way to do exercises on-the-go.</li>
<li>A very flexible language, can help with most of what I want to do.</li>
<li>Popular, lots of tutorials available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cons<ul>
<li>High-level</li>
<li>Doesn't really map well to certain algorithms (can't work with pointers, etc.)</li>
<li>A relatively slow language.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I <em>really</em> want to do C/C++ but time is of the essence so I think the best option here is Python.</p>
<h2>Sites</h2>
<p><a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/5-key-learnings-from-the-post-bootcamp-job-search-9a07468d2331">This page</a> I read last weekend was pretty insightful. Here's the sites directly lifted from that, seems like a good place to start:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.interviewcake.com/">InterviewCake</a>: My favorite resource for data structures and algorithms. It breaks down solutions into step-by-step chunks — a great alternative to Cracking the Code Interview (CTCI). My only gripe is that they don’t have more problems!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.hiredintech.com/classrooms/system-design/lesson/60">HiredInTech’s System Design Section</a>: A great guide for system design interview questions.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.educative.io/collection/5642554087309312/5679846214598656">Coderust</a>: If you’re avoiding CTCI like the plague, Coderust 2.0 may be perfect for you. For $49, you get solutions in almost any programming language, with interactive diagrams.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jov24/heres_how_to_prepare_for_tech_interviews/">Reddit’s How to Prepare for Tech Interviews</a>: I constantly used this as a benchmark for how prepared I was.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions">Front End Interview Questions</a>: An <em>exhaustive</em> list of front-end questions.</li>
<li><a href="https://leetcode.com/">Leetcode</a>: The go-to resource for algorithm and data structure questions. You can filter by company, so for example, you could get all the questions that Uber or Google typically ask.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>My notes on each:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>InterviewCake:</strong> $99 for 1 year/50 hours of practice questions. Not too bad of a deal.</li>
<li><strong>HiredInTech System Design:</strong> Looks like it's free? Not a bad deal at all. I think I got a pretty good idea of systems architecture in my last job but it might be good to formalize that.</li>
<li><strong>Coderust/educative.io:</strong> $49 for lifetime access and 83 lessons. Also a pretty good deal.<ul>
<li>By the way, CTCI refers to "Cracking the Coding Interview", which I am indeed avoiding like the plague (too popular).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Reddit article:</strong> It's Reddit, so of course it's free*, but yeah, seems like a good benchmark.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Front End Interview Questions:</strong> I'm not terribly interested in front-end development, but this could be useful.</li>
<li><strong>Leetcode:</strong> I downloaded an app that collects info from this site, not sure if it requires a subscription, which is $35/month or $159/year.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Learning Method</h2>
<p>Judging from my typical work method, I'll set a goal of 3 algorithms a day, and adjust based on my pace. I'll also need to alter the questions to protect the innocent.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Yes, this dates me as an olde time Slashdot user. Buck feta!</p>
<p>I’m writing this before I’ve even registered my domain because I want everything <em>about</em> this site chronicled <em>in</em> the site. I’ll get to my mission statement in the next post.</p>
<p>Apologies for the stream-of-consciousness nature of the prose here.</p>
<h2>Domain Registrar</h2>
<p>First order of business is to pick a domain registrar... time to start Googling. Hm, a couple of hits, a fair amount of what looks like sponsored posts... GoDaddy is fairly low-ranked which is a good sign... <a href="https://makeawebsitehub.com/go/namecheap">NameCheap</a> and <a href="https://makeawebsitehub.com/go/bluehost">BlueHost</a> might work? Providers may be gaming the algorithm, DuckDuckGo to the rescue! </p>
<p>Ech, a few articles from 2010 and 2012... </p>
<p>Ooh, <a href="https://makeawebsitehub.com/reviews/domain-registrars/">this is a nice article</a>.</p>
<p>Looks like NameCheap it is. I'll follow up if they screw me over.</p>
<h2>Site Architecture</h2>
<p>Next is how to actually implement the site. I don't really care for comments, my Wordpress site from 6-7 years ago had its comments system overrun by Russian hackers, which I blocked by disabling the comments section and removing them from the stylesheet, so I'd rather just not have them altogether. </p>
<p>A static site generator looks to be the right tool here, and I could probably leverage GitHub for hosting. Jekyll is the obvious choice, except that it'd require that I learn Ruby for modifications and Ruby is... meh. Unless you're looking to hire me, in which case, I <em>love</em> Ruby!</p>
<p>Off to <a href="https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python#static-site-generator">Awesome Python</a>... quite a few options here, looks like <a href="https://github.com/eudicots/Cactus">Cactus</a> runs on Django, also meh... <a href="https://github.com/hyde/hyde">Hyde</a> (I see what they did there) looks promising, but hasn't been updated in about two years. <a href="https://github.com/getnikola/nikola">Nikola</a> seems like a strong contender, last update was a few hours ago, might be a bit heavyweight, though... <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican">Pelican</a> looks like a contender. <a href="https://github.com/vladris/tinkerer/">Tinkerer</a> doesn't really look compatible with my knowledge base.</p>
<p>So... Nikola or Pelican. Both seem to have pretty <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/make-github-pages-blog-with-pelican/">decent</a> <a href="http://journalpanic.com/pyhi/posts/make-your-own-blog-with-github-pages-and-nikola/">tutorials</a>. Nikola looks to have a direct CLI for GitHub pages, which is nice, but also still looks fairly complicated. I think I'll go with Pelican for now, looks like it should be fairly easy to switch out if something doesn't pan out.</p>
<h2>Building the Site</h2>
<p>Time to make a <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>, um, page? Go through the tutorial, la la la... okay done, go to the site... not working? Try again a minute later... now it works. "Hello World" indeed.</p>
<p>Okay now to set up Pelican. Hm, instructions also want me to make a <code>[username].github.io-src</code> repo, okay, done... now it wants me to install the Python Pelican package? I'm not on Fedora so, no. I should probably pip install in a virtualenv... all the tutorials say to have a dedicated Pelican virtualenv? That doesn't sound right, but whatever. </p>
<p>Alright, looks like I should probably use this sequence:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>python3 -m venv Pelican
<span class="nb">cd</span> Pelican
<span class="nb">source</span> bin/activate
</pre></div>


<p>Okay, now we're in our virtualenv. Now to install Pelican and a few dependencies:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip3 install pelican
pip3 install Markdown typogrify
</pre></div>


<p>Okay, now we have our packages, time to set up the site. Doesn't seem right to do it here, maybe I can go back to the other directory?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">cd</span> ../catichenor.github.io-src
</pre></div>


<p>The next step, which I assume to be <code>git submodule add git@github.com:catichenor/catichenor.github.io.git output</code> from the tutorial, doesn't work. Eh, maybe just skip straight to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pelican-quickstart
</pre></div>


<p>Okay done.</p>
<p>Now to write up a post based on the example from the docs:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Title: This is a test.
Date: 2018-03-20 15:18
Modified: 2018-03-20 15:20
Category: Site
Tags: pelican, publishing
Slug: this-is-a-test
Authors: Christopher Tichenor
Summary: This is a test page, hopefully I can delete this.

This is a test. This is only a test.
</pre></div>


<p>Make and test the site... wow that's ugly. Okay, at least let me change the post to this one I'm typing, I can update it later.</p>
<p>Okay, that looks better, kinda. Now to publish to GitHub. Eh, looks like I didn't do the submodule thing correctly. Ugh. Okay, <code>cp -r output/* ../catichenor.github.io/</code> to the rescue here. I'll need to automate that plus probably some other stuff.</p>
<p>Next on the todo list is to get the domain stuff set up and switch up the theme but at least we have a working site. Good night!</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Okay, did a bit more tweaking here. It was bugging me that git submodules weren't being set up. After doing some digging, it looks like I need to run the following to get the submodule set up after the fact:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git submodule add https://github.com/catichenor/catichenor.github.io.git output
</pre></div>


<hr>
<p><strong>ANOTHER UPDATE:</strong> Wow, no offense to most Pelican theme makers, but most Pelican themes look awful. Chunk looks pretty decent, let's apply that... okay, I need to add the entry to the <code>pelicanconf.py</code> file in the page's source repo.</p>
<p>Okay, Chunk definitely looks better but I need to modify the links... done. The "SITE" link is annoying but I'll figure out how to hide that later.</p>
